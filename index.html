      <b>Pakistan</b>, officially the Islamic Republic of <b>Pakistan</b>, is a country
      in South Asia. It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of
      over 241.5 million, having the largest Muslim population as of 2023.

      financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area, being the
      second largest in South Asia. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the
      Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it
      shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran
      to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares a maritime border
      with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the
